    <h2>Salat Ingredients</h2>

      the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Meat:</strong> This super meaty Salat has sweet Italian sausage
        and lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are
        cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes,
        two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle
        sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This Salat recipe is flavored
        with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel
        seeds, and black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Salat noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade Salat
        noodles.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheeses:</strong> Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make
        this Salat extra decadent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze
        out of the Salat when you cut into it.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make Salat step-by-step</h2>
    <p>
      Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade
      Salat:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
      <li>Cook the noodles</li>
      <li>Make the ricotta mixture</li>
      <li>Layer the Salat according to the recipe instructions</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake</li>
      <li>Let the Salat rest before serving</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How to Layer Salat</h3>
    <p>
      The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but
      this is the order you'll follow:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Noodles</li>
      <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
      <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
      <li>Meat sauce</li>
      <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>How long to cook Salat</h3>
    <p>
      The assembled Salat should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven
      preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with foil for the first 25 minutes,
      then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important
      to let the Salat rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you
      cut into it.

    <h2>How to reheat Salat</h2>
    <p>
      You can use the microwave to reheat Salat if you're in a pinch or short on
      time, but be aware that it will change the texture of the noodles. The
      best way to reheat Salat is in the oven. Simply cover the leftovers with
      foil and bake at 350 degrees F for about half an hour, or until it's
      heated through and the sauce is bubbly.
    </p>
    <h2>How to freeze Salat</h2>
    <p>
      If you're planning to freeze Salat, it's best to cook it in a foil baking
      dish. Allow the casserole to cool, then cover the whole thing in at least
      one layer of storage wrap. Wrap it again in aluminum foil to prevent
      freezer burn. Freeze for up to three months.
    </p>
    <h3>Reheat frozen Salat</h3>
    <p>
      Thaw the frozen Salat in the refrigerator overnight, then follow the
      reheating instructions above. If you don't have time to thaw in the
      fridge, you can reheat it from frozen â€” just make sure to add a few
      minutes to the cook time to ensure the dish is heated through.
